		<h2>What the Bees are?</h2>


<p align="justify">Bees are insects with wings closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. Some species  including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees  live socially in colonies while most species including mason bees, carpenter bees, and sweat bees are solitary.
<br>

<p> Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees. Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to Megachile pluto, the largest species, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres</p>
</br>

<p align="justify">Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for their larvae. Vertebrate predators of bees include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.

<p>Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees. The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.</p>

		<h2>Featuring Bee's curiosities</h2>
		
			<div id="speakers">
			<h3><br>
				<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
				Bumble bees' Wings Beat 130 Times per Second</h3>
				<img src="f4a76ada54463c7c26f37ae2934d1b77.gif" alt="bumble bee wings">
			
			<div class="card-body">			
				<p class="card-text">That ability, combined with their large size, enables the bees to perform a 
				unique service, "buzz pollination" (vibrating flowers until they release pollen), that helps plants
				 produce more fruit. The insects' size also allows them to  fly earlier to cooler, higher altitudes, than can honey bees.</p>
			</div>

			<h3><br>
				<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
					Bees Have 5 Eyes</h3>
			<img src="bee-5eyes.jpg" alt="bee five eyes">
			<div class="card-body">
				<p class="card-text">Three of their eyes are on the top of their head and the other two are directly in front. 
				They also have hair on their eyes. These hairs aid in navigation, determining wind direction and flight speed of the bee.</p>
			</div>

			<h3><br>
				<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">They Dance</h3>
				<img src="bee-dance.gif" alt="bees dancing">
			<div class="card-body">
				<p class="card-text">You heard that right! Honeybeesâ€™ form of communication is through dance. There are two kinds of dance the waggle dance and the round dance. Waggling means the food is farther away and the round dance indicates food is nearby.</p>
